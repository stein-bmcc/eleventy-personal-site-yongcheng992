          <p class="card__text-w"> I created this magazine cover and article spread to introduce English-speaking readers to Chinese food. I wanted to create a balance layout combining text and images in a dynamic yet legible way. One of my challenges was picking images because Chinese food is extremely varied and can be divided into many types. In the end, I chose one the most representative foods for the Southern and Northern culinary traditions. </p>
